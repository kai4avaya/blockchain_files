I built graphstore 
the graph is the ui layer that controls this store
but there is a server
  that is called to update the indexdb
  whether or not it updates the indexdb we will still update the code from the indexdb

  i need to update graphstore and the graph so they talk to each other
    the graph has to be initated be graphstore 
      then the graph has to update graphstore

STEPS:
1) initiate graphstore from indexdb
2) also call server maybe in a worker to update from server in another thread
3) if indexdb is changed it will always push a graph update
4) update graph from graphstore
5) graphstore updated by graph when any change happens
6) graphstore wuill update indexdb as well
