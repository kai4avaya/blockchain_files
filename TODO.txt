filestore i believe should be immudatable... ie its our first entry when someone drags file and keeps original immudatable
graph is repreesentations of the changes over time
  - i need to update graphstore with islands  
  - so that instead of snapshot i think we need graphstore  
   - graphstore will keep the views that a person creates
    - 

 = will need to update sphere drag to record this inside of graphstore (aka islands)
  - then on cubedrag need to obtain this graphstore data to update rather than snapshot...
