reorganize 3d space by smilar articles using embeddings matches

---

need to center the 3d space - 
- so if we click a node it is active
 - when we use ai it will include that file inside the embedding query
 - we can at any time pin the note to 3d space and it resets or discard..
  when pinned it becomes a node itself.
- we should be able to drag to select multiple nodes
if we drag nodes into boxes they will then be selected as a whole (so when we click one all nodes in that cube will be selected)
- this is not a final product writing tool, but rather a way to do research
