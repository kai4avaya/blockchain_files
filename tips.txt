General Tips#
Object creation in JavaScript is expensive, so don’t create objects in a loop. Instead, create a single object such as a Vector3 and use vector.set() or similar methods to reuse a that inside the loop.
The same goes for your render loop. To make sure your app runs at a buttery smooth sixty frames per second, do as little work as possible in your render loop. Don’t create new objects every frame.
Always use BufferGeometry instead of Geometry, it’s faster.
The same goes for the pre-built objects, always use the buffer geometry version ( BoxBufferGeometry rather than BoxGeometry).
Always try to reuse objects such as objects, materials, textures etc. (although updating some things may be slower than creating new ones, see texture tips below).
